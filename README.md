Hello world intro

- Hey guys, guess what's in my hand.
- Um - A biscuit? 
- No, not even close. Jemaine? 
- Another kind of biscuit? 
- No, I haven't got a biscuit, have I? I said no biscuit. It's not gonna be another kind, is it? 
- Is it a really big biscuit? 
- It's not a biscuit! 
- I don't know, you know I'm not very imaginative.
- You've ruined this game.
